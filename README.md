What is Awesome New Tab Page?
-----------------------------
Awesome New Tab Page is my attempt at making a more awesome new tab page for [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).

How is it more awesome?
-----------------------
It's more like a home screen on an Android phone or a Windows 8 start menu. By that I mean that instead of just icons and bookmarks, you can have some very dynamic widgets that are always ready to show something useful. From the weather to the news, your _awesome_ new tab page is what _you_ make it. Customize and expand it as you choose. Awesome, like you.

I have an idea, who do I tell?
------------------------------
Well, I'd appreciate it if you posted it here: [feedback.antp.co](http://feedback.antp.co/).

However, you can also contact me directly through Google+: [h4r7.me](http://h4r7.me/).

How are widgets made?
---------------------
See the [wiki](http://wiki.antp.co/).

Widgets are packaged within Chrome extensions (either exclusively or bundled in a pre-existing extension) and, when installed, are added to the widgets window for users to add to their new tab page.

If you have any questions, please ask them here: [help.antp.co](http://help.antp.co/).
